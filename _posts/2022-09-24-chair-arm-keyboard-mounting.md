<!-- begin_excerpt -->
This keyboard mount technique achieves several things:

* The thin, angled metal plates can get lower in your lap, and closer to your shoulders, than a traditional keyboard tray.
* It has room for a trackball.
* It moves with the chair.
* It provides built-in tent and tilt adjustment, and can be adjusted on the fly.
* It can be rotated out of the way when you get up and down, so halves of a split keyboard can sit closer together than a fixed mount.
* The magnetic mounting which keeps the peripherals from falling off also means you can make small position adjustments naturally, just by sliding around the individual device.
